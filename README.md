React Native, Javascript, Expo and Firebase.

Noonan is a golf caddy mobile application offering club and shot strength options for an entered distance. These options are calculated under the hood by a custom built calculator that factors in a number of inputs like distance, wind, elevation, etc, to give the user a best guess at what shot to hit.

These calculations are based upon a “bag” of clubs entered by the user on setup. This provides a unique and tailored output for each user and their skill level.
